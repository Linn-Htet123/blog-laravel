Working with commit history
---------------------------
Check out commit - Safe (This commit history can't be edit, even after edited it doesn't save, read-only)
Revert commit - Unsafe  (can be edit | can result commit history destroyed)
Reset commit - Danger   (return back to the past commit and remove the present commit)

git checkout <filename>     (Read the old commit)
git switch -  (or)  git checkout <HEAD branch>  (Return back to original commit)

git revert <filename>       (Move to old commit and create new commit in the old spot)

git reset <filename>        (Change to the past commit without removing everything)
git reset <filename> --hard (Change to the past commit with removing everything)


Working with branch, merge
--------------------------
git branch <branch-name>    (Create new branches)
git branch -a               (Show all branches)
git checkout <branch-name>  (Change current branch)
git branch -b <branch-name> (Create and Change to new branch)
git branch -d <branch-name> (Delete branch)


Working with remote-repo
------------------------
git branch -M <branch-name>         (Set Master branch)
git remote add origin <url>         (Adding remote origin)
git remote -v                       (Check curretn remote origin)

git push -u origin <branch-name>    (Push the files to remote-repo)
git push -f origin <branch-name>    (Force Push the files to remote-repo, Even when local commit is behind the remote commit)

git pull <url>                      (Pulling the master branch from remote-repo)

git push origin -d <branch-name>    (Delete the remote-repo branch)
